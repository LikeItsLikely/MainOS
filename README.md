# MainOS

### Official Website / Project site: https://maingron.com/about_mainos

MainOS is a browser based Windows XP clone thing. It is inspired by Microsofts Windows XP and other Windows versions. I started MainOS at work, because my boss told me to learn CSS. Since that day I develop MainOS.

If you want to contribute, that would be nice. It's hard to keep up as a single person.
