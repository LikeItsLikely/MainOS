# MainOS
MainOS is a browser based Windows XP clone thing. You can try it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://maingron.de/mainos">MainOS on itch.io</a>.

MainOS is inspired by Microsofts Windows XP and other Windows versions. I started MainOS at work, because my boss told me to learn CSS. Since that day I develop MainOS.

If you want to contribute, that would be nice. It's hard to keep up as a single person.
